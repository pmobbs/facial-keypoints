# Facial Keypoints

In this project I define and training a convolutional neural network to perform facial keypoint detection, and using computer vision techniques to transform images of faces.

## Getting Started

You will need to get the YouTube Faces Dataset in order to run the training: https://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~wolf/ytfaces/ 

### Prerequisites

This project was developed using jupyter notebooks and pytorch. You will need these in order to make use of these notebooks.

### Installing

No installation necessary beyond dowloading the dataset and unzipping it into the data/ subdirectory under the path where these files are checked-out.
